# CORE-Language-Interpreter
CORE language is a custom language that supports most common structures used in programming languages (loops, statements, if statements, etc). This language only supports integers. Hope to expand it to other types. The interpreter is written in the java language. Tokenizer converts valid tokens into integers and outputs them to the console. The Parse Tree creates a AST or abstract syntax tree of the valid tokens generated by the Tokenizer. The parse tree is displayed in the console as a formatted program. The CORE Language Interpreter is the execution part of the interpreter which allows user input for variables (integer type). The AST (parse tree creation) and tokenizer run in the background instead of displaying output. If any errors are caught, the execution haults and the error and location is reported to the console. These programs are meant to be run through the console / terminal
